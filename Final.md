After finishing all the milestones and polishing, the game is now ready for submission.

The game is a simple dungeon runner with obstacles, where you can upgrade your character to make completing the levels easier. You have the option to upgrade movement speed, jump force, and health, as well as unlock sliding. Sliding is especially useful because it provides a significant speed boost over any surface.

As mentioned in previous blogpost the game has no story. The core gameplay focuses on navigating through challenging dungeon environments filled with traps and obstacles. Players must time their jumps, avoid hazards, and use their upgrades strategically to progress through each level. Collectibles and rewards are scattered throughout the levels, encouraging exploration and replayability.

Currently, two levels are available to play, each offering a slightly different experience. The first level introduces basic mechanics and obstacles, while the second level increases the difficulty with more complex layouts and additional hazards. Each level is designed to test the player's reflexes and decision-making skills.

I have decided to use assets, mainly a dungeon pack asset which provided the walls, props and some obstacles to make the game visually appealing. This was done at the end of the project, so the project was developed with simple graphics.

I wouldn't call the game finished. There is still plenty of room for improvement, such as adding more levels and introducing advanced movement mechanics. Different themes for the levels could enhance visual variety, and implementing additional sound effects and background music would improve the overall experience. There is also potential to adapt the game for mobile devices with touch controls, which could be explored after the submission.
