The second milestone is done where I mainly made the objects which are not directly related to the first game scene.

I made a simple main menu first with the option to start the levels, a page for upgrading the character and exiting the game. I have spent quite a lot of time figuring out how to be able to navigate the UI elements with a controller and make it work with the playerInput which was provided. I had to make sure when the new UI element become active, one object is selected by default to be able to navigate. The layout itself is simple and basic but makes the job done. 

Next task was implementing the upgrade system, which I personally enjoyed the most. The user can upgrade the character's movement speed, HP and jumping power and also unlock sliding. Next, I was researching how to save these values in a way that is persistent and able to move between scenes. There were two options which I was deciding in between. One is working with JSON files and the other one with PlayerPrefs. I went forward with the PlayerPrefs which is saving basic values locally which was enough for me because I only needed to save numbers. Another reason I went with it is because I have worked with a similar system in C++ called QSettings and I liked the simplicity of it.
The reason I enjoyed this part is because it was purely coding challenge. First, I created one big UpgradeManager where the upgrade functions were separated, then made it more and more compact with enums and helper functions to help with the consistency. Unfortunately, I realized later that, if by any chance I have to create another upgrade I would have to change the upgradeManager in multiple places. Because of this I decided to separate the upgrades with interface, this way the system is easily extendable. It is not a perfect system, but I enjoyed creating it is working for the current needs, and I am able to add more upgrades if needed.

The next task was for the rest of the system to parse these new values and use them for the movementSpeed and HP etc... The values are broken on purpose because in this stage, I didn't want to focus on finding the perfect values for the upgrades. I left it for the polishing phase. Also, it was clearly visible if the system was working or not.

Next task was to make the UI when the character dies/wins the level. The graphics are simple and straightforward, instead I was focusing on how it works from the coding side, which I noticed that I care more about that part than any other part (UpgradeManager).
I have also created the second level, where I am starting to realize that the obstacles are too basic and not giving enough variety to the levels. That's a problem I created early on and might not have time to improve it. 

In the next phase I am planning to improve the movement, the animations, add sounds and just basically try to polish and refactor parts of the code.
