The third milestone for the game is ready. I was focusing on some smaller settings and started using assets for level creation.

In this phase, I was optimizing the animations and the corresponding movements. This involved mainly changing the max level of the upgrades and the basic values and then testing if it feels good. I didn't have a specific way of figuring out the numbers, just started the game and tested if it is okay or not. I also tested adding sounds to the game. I started off with walking sounds but couldn't find an audio clip which would be good. Although I would like to add background music and experiment with other sound e.g. gold pickup just to get to know that system as well. 

I decided to download some assets from the asset store, mainly to see how to work with them as well. After downloading, I noticed all the materials were pink and I thought that the asset is broken. after some assets I realized something must be wrong with my setup and it was. The game and the assets were not for the same render pipeline. Luckily, it was easy to convert the assets, and they were ready to use it. I was a little hesitant to use assets, mainly because I didn't know how easy it is to use them and to not bloat the game with them. I am not sure if I went overboard with it, but I did have fun placing the props around and giving some shape to the game. Also, after figuring out how it works it was quite fast to put together a level.

I also added particles to the lava because it was bland without it and wanted to include them into the project. Plus, it was a way to introduce myself to the particles.

After that, there were some noticeable bugs with the coins not being in their proper place which were solved. With the deadline being close, A YouTube video is still needed, the documents and some miscellaneous refactoring and sounds to the game.
