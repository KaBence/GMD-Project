For the first milestone, the goal was to have the basic gameplay ready. This meant that the basics of the first level were completed, with obstacles in place and all movement and interactions with the environment were ready. Even though it is far from finished — as it still needs polishing and optimization — I would consider the first milestone complete. When the game starts, the character begins the first level and moves through the map. It is possible to die or fall off the map. However, there is currently no death cycle or "Level Completed" state. That will be the next step.

I started working on this project knowing that reaching this milestone would take some time. I had to learn Unity, set up the foundation, and create prefabs for level design. From this point on, the process should be faster, focusing on more levels, making the gameplay loop enjoyable and polishing the game.

I began the project with a lot of ideas, thinking I would create a fully finished game, implementing all the ideas on my own within this limited timeframe. That didn’t happen. I had difficulties getting used to Unity, which slowed down my progress and affected my motivation to work on the game. But after some time, things improved as I became more familiar with the environment. There is still much more to learn, but now I have a better understanding of Unity and the mindset it requires, which I hope to continue improving over time.

I still have many ideas written down on how to enhance the gameplay making the game more complex and enjoyable. However, I’m not sure if that should be the priority, given that the game needs to be finished by a deadline.
