The Game I would like to make for the GMD course is a basic runner game, that are playable on phones, but done right. The problem with those games is that, since it a mobile game, they are full of pointless ads and just trying to rip you off by spending more time watching than actually playing.

The project has to fit with the controls of the arcade machine, so it cannot be too complicated, which is not problem for this game, since you only need the directions to move, jump, duck, and possibly use a grapple hook.
This way it can be run on the arcade, webgl and maybe as a mobile game as well. But for that, the controls has to be adjusted for touchscreen which could be a nice addition after the project is complete.

Since the gameplay loop is simple, just jump in, do one run and be finished if you like, it higly resembles an arcade game which can be grinded for power-ups, higher score etc... This way, there is no story to follow or characters to remember.

There are two options for the level design: Either make the level random generated and make an endless runner, or make levels which you can only beat if you buy power-ups(higher movement speed, faster jump etc...) both options are on the table but I like the second option better currently.

The game will have a top down view runner style with simple graphics focusing on the game-mechanics, where the screen in split so it can accomodate two player at the same time, but they are not connected in any way. This means, even though it is split-screen game it is a single-player game.

The 3 milestones for the project could be:
    Have the basic gameplay ready
    Main menu, ability to save, powerups
    polishing
